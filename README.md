 Today I learned some test-driven development.

 The basic steps of test-driven development:
 1. decide what your function should do
 2. write a test for the correct outlet (this should fail since you haven't written the code yet)
 3. write the function
 4. make sure it passes the tests

 Once you have a testing suite in place, you should be able to avoid breaking your code by running the tests. If you additions don't pass all the tests, you're most likely good.

End To End and Unit Testing are two different things.

Unit testing involves checking for the correct output from certain functions.

End to End testing involves making sure that the entire flow of an application works.
